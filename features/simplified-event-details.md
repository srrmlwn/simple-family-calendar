# Simplified Event Details Interface

## Overview
The event details interface has been simplified to provide a more focused and intuitive user experience. The changes emphasize natural language input, inline editing, and a clean bottom sheet interface.

## Implemented Changes

### Bottom Sheet Interface
- Converted event details to a bottom sheet modal
- Responsive design:
  - Mobile: Slides up from bottom with rounded top corners
  - Desktop: Centered modal with rounded corners on all sides
- Smooth animations for opening/closing
- Proper overflow handling
- Adaptive height based on content
- Maximum height constraints:
  - Mobile: 85vh
  - Desktop: 600px
- Proper spacing and margins:
  - Desktop: 16px margin from screen edges
  - Mobile: Full width with proper padding

### Event Form Improvements
1. **Natural Language Interface**
   - Single-line sentence format: "[Event] from [time] to [time] at [location]"
   - Inline editable fields with clear visual feedback
   - Smart date/time parsing supporting multiple formats:
     - "Jan 15"
     - "Jan 15, 3:30 PM"
     - "3:30 PM"
     - "Jan 15 2024"
     - "Jan 15 2024, 3:30 PM"
     - "2024-01-15"
     - "2024-01-15 15:30"

2. **Editable Fields**
   - Visual indicators for editable fields:
     - Hover state with subtle border
     - Pencil icon appears on hover
     - Active state with blue highlight and ring
   - Inline validation with error messages
   - Clear visual feedback for invalid states
   - Proper spacing between fields and connecting words

3. **Removed Fields**
   - Description field removed
   - Color selection removed
   - Simplified to focus on essential information

4. **Action Buttons**
   - Replaced emoji buttons with flat icons:
     - Save: Checkmark icon (green on hover)
     - Cancel: X icon (red on hover)
     - Delete: Trash can icon (red on hover)
   - Clear tooltips for button actions
   - Proper disabled states
   - Consistent spacing and padding

5. **Validation & Feedback**
   - Removed confusing "ready to save" status message
   - Inline validation for date/time fields
   - Clear error messages for invalid inputs
   - End time validation to ensure it's after start time
   - Save button tooltip shows validation requirements
   - Error messages for network/operation failures

### Technical Improvements
1. **Component Structure**
   - Separated concerns between `BottomSheet`, `EventDetails`, and `EventForm`
   - Proper state management for validation
   - Efficient handling of form updates
   - Responsive design considerations

2. **Accessibility**
   - Proper ARIA labels and roles
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Focus management
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Proper contrast ratios

3. **Performance**
   - Optimized animations
   - Efficient state updates
   - Proper cleanup of event listeners
   - Smooth transitions

## Future Considerations
1. **Potential Enhancements**
   - Add support for recurring events
   - Implement drag-and-drop for time adjustments
   - Add quick templates for common event types
   - Consider adding a minimal description field for longer events

2. **User Testing**
   - Gather feedback on the natural language interface
   - Test with different date/time input formats
   - Validate the mobile experience
   - Check accessibility with screen readers

## Implementation Notes
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Implements responsive design patterns
- Follows React best practices
- Maintains type safety with TypeScript
- Uses Heroicons for consistent iconography
